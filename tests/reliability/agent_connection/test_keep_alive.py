type: reliability

brief: Agents once they register to the manager, they will start communicating with the manager.
       In this process, they send a keep-alive message to the manager, which will respond in normal
       conditions with an ACK. The difference between keep-alive and ACK should not exceed 20 seconds.

    description: Check if the communication between managers and agents works as expected.
    This test ensures that ACK and keep alive does not overcome the specified maximum. The condition is checked using
    the agentd statistics data and the keep-alives received by the manager in the logs file.

            brief: Get the JSON environment report.

    assertions:
        - Verify agents maximum difference between ack and keepalive is less than specified maximum.
        - Verify that the max_difference between keeps alives of all the agents in the managers side is less that
        the specified maximum.
        - Verify the number of keepalives of each agent is the expected.
