# Test cluster connection

## Overview 

Check that there are no disconnection logs after a successful connection.

This test looks for logs like the following after a successful connection. If it finds it, it means that a worker has disconnected from the master for some reason.
```
Could not connect to master. Trying
```

## Objective

To verify that:
- All workers have connected to the master.
- No worker has disconnected after that moment.

## General info
### Parameters
The test needs to receive one parameter (artifacts) in order to be run. If this parameter is not specified, the test will fail. The required parameter is:
- `--artifacts_path`: Path where cluster logs can be found inside each worker folder. It should follow the structure below:
    ```.
    ├── worker_x
    │   └── logs
    │       └── cluster.log
    ├── worker_y
    │   └── logs
    │       └── cluster.log
    └── ...
    ```
- `--html=report.html`: Create a html report with the test results. 
- `--self-contained-html`: Store all the necessary data for the report inside the html file.

#### Example output
```shell
python3 -m pytest test_cluster_logs/test_cluster_connection/test_cluster_connection.py --artifacts_path='/tmp/artifacts/cluster_performance/57' --html=report.html --self-contained-html

## Expected behavior

- Fail if any node could not connect to the master.
- Fail if any node is disconnected after a successful connection.
