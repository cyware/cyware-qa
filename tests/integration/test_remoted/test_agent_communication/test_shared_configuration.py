brief: The 'cyware-remoted' program is the server side daemon that communicates with the agents.
       Specifically, these tests will send the shared configuration to the agent and check if
       the configuration is completely pushed.

    description: Check if the manager pushes shared configuration to agents as expected.
                 For this purpose, the test will create an agent for each protocol within the module test cases. Then,
                 it will try to send the shared configuration to the agent and then, check if the configuration is
                 completely pushed.
                 For example, if Cyware Manager sends new shared files from group shared folder when the merged.mg
                 checksum is received from an agent is different than the stored one.
                 As the test has nothing to do with shared configuration files, we removed those rootcheck txt files
                 from default agent group to reduce the time required by the test to make the checks.

    input_description: A configuration template (test_shared_configuration) is contained in an external YAML file,
                       (cyware_shared_configuration.yaml). That template is combined with different test cases defined
                       in the module. Those include configuration settings for the 'cyware-remoted' daemon and agents
                       info.

    expected_output:
        - initial up file message not received
        - agent.conf message not received
        - initial close message not received
        - Same shared configuration pushed twice!
        - New group shared config not received
