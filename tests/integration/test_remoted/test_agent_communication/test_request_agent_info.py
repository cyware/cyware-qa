brief: The 'cyware-remoted' program is the server side daemon that communicates with the agents.
       Specifically, these tests will check that the manager can communicate correctly with the
       agent to ask for its information.

    description: Check that there are no problems when the manager tries to communicate with an agent to ask for
                 configuration or state files using the remoted socket. For this purpose, the test will create agents
                 and then, for each agent, it will wait until the agent key is loaded by remoted. After that, a request
                 is sent depending on the test case, and it checks if the response is the expected one for that case.
                 If the agent is disconnected, it raises an error.
                 As the test has nothing to do with shared configuration files, we removed those rootcheck txt files
                 from default agent group to reduce the time required by the test to make the checks.
