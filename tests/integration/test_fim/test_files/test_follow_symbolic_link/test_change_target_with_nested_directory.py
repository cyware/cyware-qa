brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when these files
       are modified. Specifically, these tests will verify that no FIM events are generated in the final
       target of the 'symbolic link' when it has already been monitored.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'cyware-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files for
       changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

pytest_args:
    - fim_mode:
        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

    description: Check if the 'cyware-syscheckd' daemon stops detecting events when the target of a monitored symlink
                 is changed to a new folder. For example, having a 'symbolic link' pointing to a folder that contains
                 another monitored directory. Changing the target should not trigger 'added' events for the monitored
                 subdirectory on the next scan. For this purpose, the test will monitor a 'symbolic link' pointing to
                 a directory which contains a monitored subdirectory. Once FIM starts, it will create and expect
                 events inside the pointed folder. After the events are processed, the test will change the target
                 of the link to another folder, and wait until the thread that checks the 'symbolic links' updates
                 the target of the link. Finally, it will verify that no events are triggered inside
                 the monitored subdirectory.
